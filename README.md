### UDACITY's DOG PROJECT

I completed this project as part of UDACITY's deep-learning nanodegree. The goal of this project was to develop a CNN-model that would take user-provided images and predict the breed of the dog. The model was trained on ~7000 training images representing 133 breeds. The final model accuracy on a test set was >80%.
